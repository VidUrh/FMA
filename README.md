# FMA - Finance Management App

This is a lightweight, portable Python desktop application for managing choir finances. It uses an SQLite database to store and manage financial data, and has an intuitive user experience. The app has been converted to an executable file (.exe) for wider usage on Windows systems.

## MUST HAVE FEATURES

- View the current financial status of the choir at any time.
- View the balances of individual choir members.

## FUTURE IDEAS

- Generate financial reports for a given period of time.
- View expenses (and incomes) by category.
- Use the app for other management activities, such as keeping track of choir equipment.

## FUTURE FUTURISTIC IDEAS

- Automate the data insertion process by posting an image of an invoice and using optical character recognition (OCR) technology to extract the data.

## DEVELOPMENT

[ ] Design and build a database to store financial data.
[ ] Create user interfaces to allow the user to view and interact with the data.
[ ] Implement additional features, such as report generation and expense categorization.
[ ] Consider using OCR technology to automate the data insertion process.
